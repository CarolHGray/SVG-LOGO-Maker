# SVG Logo Maker

## Description

A command line application that generates a professional looking SVG logo.  A professional Logo enhances your business or organization.  This application lets you design and generate a logo for free.  The project introduced me to using inquirer, SVG files and tests using Jest.

## Usage
Enter node index.js in the command line.  You will be prompted to enter 3 characters, text color, shape, and color of the shape.  After you answer the questions, the application generates an SVG file with code to make a logo based on your answers.
